					<h2>Thoughts</h2>
					<p>Not too much this time, I found this one pretty easy! Task X was fun but not super difficult either.<br><br>
						I got curious about how Professor had done the heart border on his Unavoidable Disaster website before -
						so I went to see if I could do an animated star border on my special divs too! The 
						<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-image">MDN reference</a> on the border-image 
						property was really useful, as well as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">w3Schools page</a> on CSS animations!
