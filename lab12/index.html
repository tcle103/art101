					<h2>Thoughts</h2>
					<p>
						Pretty easy so far, I had a pretty good handle on how to approach the script. I wanted to try writing my own hash function 
						not based on the one the professor linked, but I couldn't really think of a unique approach... So I just end up using that. 
						It works pretty well though, so I'm pretty happy! As of right now I haven't done any styling yet but I'll get to it.
