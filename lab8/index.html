			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to learn how to create and call callback functions, using both regular and anon functions! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Thoughts</h2>
					<p>This lab was pretty fun! I didn't have too much trouble with callback functions, and I got to do the Task X stuff too! <br><br>
						I did some minimal CSS stuff but nothing too crazy - I did have to figure out how to stop html from collapsing my spaces.<br><br>
						My callback function that I wrote myself end up being kind of trivial (I'm sure it's possible to write just as one function), but it was fun to do!
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Check the output of my script in console... or right here! </p>
