            THIRD ITERATION!!! Now it should have support on for pretty much all browsers except IE, which, to be honest, I'm not
            too pressed about. Same as last time, credit to <a href="https://codepen.io/noeldelgado/pen/ByxQjL">Noel Delgado's X-Ray SVG experiment</a> 
            which I referenced for my last two attempts, and now thank you to <a href="https://codepen.io/yoksel/full/GRodvp">yoksel's clipping masking demo page</a> 
            for helping me find an alternative to masking HTML elements (which is somehow not supported by anyone other than Firefox). <br><br>
            Functionally, this is pretty much very similar to <a href="../flashlightdemo1/index.html">Flashlight Demo 1,</a> with two major changes:
            <ol>
                <li>The mask now only consists of the black circle without any white background</li>
                <li>It now uses clip-path in the CSS to clip the div, which has better support</li>
            </ol>
            It has pretty much all of the same benefits and functionality as last time it seems, except that clipping doesn't support using a radial gradient.
            My lovely soft edge :( <br><br>
            I do miss the visuals of the mask a bit, but other than that I'm pretty happy that it seems to work! Can totally use this!
