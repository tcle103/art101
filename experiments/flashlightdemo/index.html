            This works by making a mask with inline SVGs - a black circle on a white background - and using that to mask or
            "punch a hole" in a big black rectangle that covers the elements beneath it. I thought it was pretty interesting 
            to be able to do this without having to make some kind of external asset to use as a mask, like an SVG drawn in 
            Inkscape or a raster photo. <br><br>
            The use of SVGs here lets you manipulate/animate the mask itself without CSS animation stuff, instead being able
            to handle it all in JS, which as far as I can tell lets us give it more interactivity! It was challenging having to 
            handle the fact that coordinates within the SVG container are calculated differently from DOM coordinates, and I end 
            up having to reference other materials heavily in order to get the mouse-following effect on the mask. <br><br>
            The resource that I referenced and was inspired by the most was by far 
            <a href="https://codepen.io/noeldelgado/pen/ByxQjL">Noel Delgado's "X-ray me" SVG demo,</a> though our demos differ 
            in that I didn't want the elements underneath to be within the SVG container, since it may be harder to work 
            with elements within the limitations of the SVG container, and that rather than "punching a hole"
            to show what's underneath instead clips or "cuts out" the element underneath in the window's shape.<br><br>
            Upon further experimentation I found I could use the moving mask to clip images and even whole divs 
            of content, but because this method requires some static element like an image or a SVG container or whatever to exist 
            on top of the others, I believe this makes it so that I can't interact the elements underneath. Ultimately this technique 
            then doesn't really work how I had intended, but I think the layering of inline SVGs and the masking 
            clipping stuff can totally be used for neat limited-interaction animated effects. It could probably work if you wanted the 
            SVG container itself to be interactive, such as clicking on or hovering triggering something! <br><br>
            Future things to explore: adding interactivity to objects within inline SVG containers that may make this work, and otherwise 
            finding other ways to implement a similar effect!
