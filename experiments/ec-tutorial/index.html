					<h2><i>How to...</i> Paper Prototype!</h2>

					<h3>Intro</h3>
					<p>Between taking two of Wes's classes last year and CMPM 170 (Rapid Prototyping) this quarter, 
						I've become... quite familiar with paper prototyping.</p>
					<p>
						Paper protopying is a way to create very quick, low effort "toys" (aka, interactable units) that 
						can be used to test out the look and feel of a mechanic. The benefit of paper prototyping is the
						low fidelity of the resulting toy; you can churn them out at a pace that keeps your brainstorming
					 	and ideation going at a fast clip! On the other hand, they can quickly become very finicky if you 
						attempt to create an interaction that involves too many moving parts... it's best to use paper 
						prototypes for interactions that are simpler, zooming into a "game" to focus on a small, specific 
						action.
					</p>
					<p>Here's an example of me walking through a paper prototype I did for CMPM 170:</p>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jlseyXQXXFg?si=YZIt4Qr_RBy7iofd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
						This paper prototype was based on the <i>action verb</i> "snap" (more on that later). The concept was that 
						players would "snap" apart and together parts of different animals in order to create new animals; you can see 
						that the basic interaction is modeled in being able to physically tear apart and put together the animal images.
					</p>
					<p>
						As you can also tell from my example, paper prototypes really, totally, truly, and completely embody "low-fi" - 
						I didn't even draw my own animal pictures! However, the player's interaction with the game's core mechanic is 
						readily observed, and thus can be iterated and improved upon... so with that, let's learn how to make one!
					</p>
