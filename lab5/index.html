					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with my partner in order to figure out how to declare and utilise variables in our JavaScript code! 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Thoughts</h2>
					<p>No real problems here - I'm a lot better at the actual code-y part than stuff like CSS, it seems!
						This file already had a link to the JavaScript - would that affect where it was rendered later? I guess I can uncomment to find out. <br><br>
						I did that... doesn't seem to change much? How strange. Is it the DEFER? How do we control where JavaScript executes/outputs?
					</p>
