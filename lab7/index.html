					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to learn how to take user input, pass that input to functions, and manipulate strings!</p>

					<h2>Thoughts</h2>
					<p>I had a lot of fun with this lab! I spent a ton of time completing all of the Task X experiments, and I think I managed to pull them off successfully!
						My lab.js file is now a few hundred lines though, haha... <br><br>
						I had a lot of fun messing around with CSS too in formatting my anagram div for Task X #4. I don't really know what webkit is, but I 
						found a solution for masking a background image using text for it, plus explored how to overlay text on top of an image... I think the result works! 
						It does look kind of funny with different lengths of names, but I think it's in a way I can accept. Overall, I had a lot of fun!
