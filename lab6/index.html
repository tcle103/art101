					<p>The challenge of the lab was to learn how to declare arrays and objects and how to reference them and their items!</p>

						This lab came pretty easily, I was a little confused about objects at first but they make sense to me now. They're basically classes in Python! 
						It was really interesting to see one of the attributes of the object be in and of itself a function. 
						Referencing that the first time in console was confusing but seeing the professor made it obvious that you had to call the function to get the result - 
						just referencing the name without () just prints the function itself.<br><br>
						I'm interested to know: when printing the output of the JavaScript into the page, why the age attribute doesn't even get printed at all. Is it cause
						it's a function? Is there something else I have to do to get it to print? <br><br>
						Nothing too ambitious in CSS - I used last week's image discovery as a jumping point to see if I could arrange divs in the same way, so I could
						write a caption for the image. It worked!
