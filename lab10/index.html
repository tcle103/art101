					<p>The challenge of this lab was to learn how to manipulate the DOM and continue to experiment with JavaScript!</p>

					<h2>Thoughts</h2>
					<p>
						I had fun with this lab! Thoguh, I think I have fun with most of the labs in this class. I didn't really have 
						any significant trouble with any portions of the lab, but messing around with form elements (to do the user 
						input text box) for the first time was really interesting. On submit, it seems that forms automatically refresh 
						the page - probably part of the way it communicates the results back to the server? But that would then clear 
						any sort of output that my submit event handler would try to put out - whether that's console.log() or appending 
						to the output div. Ultimately what I end up doing was "faking" the submit; technically, the input doesn't get 
						sent anywhere serverwise, but I use jQuery to grab the text in the textbox and clear it, making the result 
						available to my script! I had to specify this for both clicking the fake submit button (which is actually just a 
						regular HTML button vs a real form submit button) and for "Return" key press submit behavior.<br><br>
						I spent a good bit of time messing with the CSS to get the text interface and bubbles to look the way I wanted it 
						to. I had to specify a lot like how to deal with multiple bubbles, overflow in the text bubbles and display window, 
						and formatting the input stuff. I'm super happy with how it looks! I think the most fun part of doing these labs 
						is doing these little detailed, formatting things - plus some fun touches like adding delay to the website's response 
						and randomizing the number of text bubbles it sends! All in all, I had a great time and learned a lot! Yay!
